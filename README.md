This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in React Native's FlatList and SectionList components. The issue arises when the data source updates, but the list fails to re-render correctly. The `IncorrectDataUpdate.js` file showcases the problematic code. The solution, found in `CorrectDataUpdate.js`, addresses this by using appropriate keys and ensuring data immutability.
